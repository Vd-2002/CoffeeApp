# CoffeeApp
This coffee app provides users with a seamless experience, allowing them to browse and add various coffee products, along with related items, to their cart. While users can go through the process of ordering coffee, it's important to note that this project is focused solely on front-end development. As a result, there are no backend functionalities like API integrations or database management for actual product ordering or data storage. The app serves as a demonstration of front-end skills, utilizing HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and interactive user interface. This project highlights the core capabilities of designing and structuring web applications from a user experience perspective without the complexity of backend development.
